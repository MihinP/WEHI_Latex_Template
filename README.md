## Phylosophy

- KISS.
- Easy to use.
- Organized, elegant, coherent and consistent.
- Compact, but not crowded.
- Compatible with `pdflatex`.
- No strange packages.


## Build

You can build it with your favourite LaTeX frontend. Also, this project can easily be built with `pdflatex`. In the project directory, run:

```
$ pdflatex main.tex
$ bibtex main
$ makeglossaries main
$ pdflatex main.tex
```



## Usage

The file structure of Alc√°zar is simple and self-explanatory. Some important things:

- `main.tex` is, as its name indicates, the main document. There you will find some variable definitions, fill them in according to your thesis and the document will update all occurrences automatically.
- Fill in your details about the authors, licence, etc. in the file `opening/about.tex`.

## Fix    

- [ ] Inconsistent skips above and below floats, too much space sometimes.
- [ ] Inconsistent skips above and below titles
- [ ] Hyphenation is weird?
- [ ] In listings, for some reason the comments of lots of `%` are bugged.
