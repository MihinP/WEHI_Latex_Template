  abstract = {Ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) are ligand-gated ion channels that play crucial roles in the central nervous system. iGluR homologs, termed glutamate receptor-like channels (GLRs), have been found in plants. Investigating the structural and functional relationship between iGluRs and GLRs was limited by GLR protein expression, purification, and structural characterization. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for Arabidopsis thaliana GLR3.4 (AtGLR3.4) expression in a mammalian cell line and purification for structure determination by cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). For the complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Green et~al. (2021).},

  abstract = {The Surface Evolver is a computer program that minimizes the energy of a surface subject to constraints. The surface is represented as a simplicial complex. The energy can include surface tension, gravity and other forms. Constraints can be geometrical constraints on vertex positions or constraints on integrated quantities such as body volumes. The minimization is done by evolving the surface down the energy gradient. This paper describes the mathematical model used and the operations available to interactively modify the surface.},
